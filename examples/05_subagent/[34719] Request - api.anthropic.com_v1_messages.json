Here's what the results reveal:\n\n## Key Barriers to Enterprise AI Agent Adoption in 2026\n\n### Top Challenges Identified\n\nThe three primary challenges are: integration with existing systems (46%), data access and quality (42%), and change management needs (39%).\n\nAccording to nearly 60% of AI leaders surveyed, their organization's primary challenges in adopting agentic AI are integrating with legacy systems and addressing risk and compliance concerns, followed closely by lack of technical expertise.\n\n### Security and Governance Concerns\n\n62% of practitioners and 53% of leadership identified security as a top challenge in developing and deploying AI agents. Security and data privacy concerns (18%) are the biggest barriers delaying AI agent adoption.\n\n49% of practitioners and 40% of leadership highlighted data governance as a significant concern in AI agent deployment.\n\n### Integration and Interoperability\n\n87% of IT leaders rated interoperability as either \"very important\" or \"crucial\" to the successful adoption of agentic AI. Nearly 95% of IT leaders report integration as a hurdle to effective AI implementation.\n\n### Technical Complexity\n\nMulti-agent systems are technically challenging to build and operate, and vendors are hesitant to make such systems interoperable as they figure out how to monetize the data the agents generate and consume.\n\n### Business Value and ROI Pressure\n\nMany organizations struggle to move agentic AI from theory to practical return on investment (ROI). Without well-defined applications, leaders risk investing in experiments that don't scale or demonstrate return, slowing buy-in and funding.\n\n\"Enterprises will need to see real ROI in their spend, and countries need to see meaningful increases in productivity growth to keep the AI spend and infrastructure going\" in 2026.\n\n### Current Adoption Status\n\nClose to 3 in 4 enterprises (72%) are now using or testing AI agents, and 79% of organizations say they have adopted AI agents to some extent. However, while 39% of organizations say they are experimenting with agents, only 23% have begun scaling AI agents within one business function.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
