      15 +Today's unicorn has evolved far beyond its medieval roots,     
         +undergoing a remarkable transformation that has positioned it  
         +as one of the most commercially successful and culturally      
         +significant symbols of the 21st century. In contemporary       
         +culture, unicorns have become synonymous with magic, wonder,   
         +and individuality, serving as powerful emblems of              
         +self-expression and non-conformity. The "unicorn trend" has    
         +swept through virtually every aspect of modern life, from      
         +fashion and food to entertainment and technology, creating a   
         +multi-billion dollar industry built around this mythical       
         +creature.                                                      
      16                                                                 
      17 +In the culinary world, the unicorn phenomenon has manifested   
         +in spectacular fashion. Rainbow-colored unicorn cakes adorned  
         +with edible glitter and fondant horns have become Instagram    
         +sensations, while unicorn frappuccinos, bagels, and ice cream  
         +have sparked viral social media moments and drawn crowds of    
         +eager consumers. The beverage industry has seen unicorn-themed 
         + lattes and smoothies featuring layers of pastel colors, while 
         + bakeries compete to create increasingly elaborate             
         +unicorn-inspired confections. This food trend speaks to a      
         +broader cultural desire for whimsy and visual spectacle in an  
         +age dominated by social media sharing.                         
      18 +                                                               
      19 +The fashion and beauty industries have equally embraced the    
         +unicorn aesthetic. Sparkly unicorn merchandise fills retail    
         +stores, from clothing and accessories to home decor items.     
         +Cosmetic companies have launched unicorn-themed makeup         
         +collections featuring iridescent highlighters, holographic     
         +nail polishes, and hair dyes in fantasy colors like pastel     
         +pink, lavender, and mint green. The "unicorn hair" trend,      
         +characterized by rainbow-colored dyes and opalescent hues, has 
         + become a mainstream fashion statement, moving from            
         +alternative subcultures into everyday style.                   
      20 +                                                               
      21 +In entertainment, unicorns have galloped across screens both   
         +big and small. Countless children's books celebrate these      
         +magical creatures, while animated films and television series  
         +feature unicorns as central characters, teaching lessons about 
         + friendship, courage, and believing in oneself. Streaming      
         +platforms host entire franchises built around unicorn          
         +protagonists, and toy manufacturers produce endless variations 
         + of unicorn dolls, plushies, and playsets that dominate wish   
         +lists worldwide.                                               
      22 +                                                               
      23 +Perhaps most intriguingly, the tech industry has adopted the   
         +term "unicorn" to describe startup companies valued at over    
         +one billion dollars, suggesting rarity and exceptional         
         +success. This corporate appropriation of unicorn mythology     
         +reflects how the creature's symbolism of uniqueness and magic  
         +translates into business narratives about innovation and       
         +disruption. The term has become so ubiquitous in Silicon       
         +Valley that it now appears in investor pitches, business       
         +school curricula, and economic analysis, creating an           
         +interesting parallel between mythical beasts and modern        
         +entrepreneurship.                                              
      24 +                                                               
      25 +The modern unicorn renaissance also reflects deeper            
         +psychological and sociological trends. For millennials and     
         +Generation Z, unicorns represent an embrace of childhood       
         +nostalgia combined with a rejection of cynicism. They serve as 
         + permission to maintain wonder and playfulness in adult life,  
         +pushing back against societal pressures to be serious and      
         +conventional. In this way, the unicorn has become a symbol of  
         +resistance against mundane reality, offering a colorful escape 
         + into fantasy that feels increasingly necessary in our         
         +complex, often overwhelming world.                             
      26 +                                                               
      27  **Why Unicorns Endure**                                        
      28                                                                 
      29  The unicorn's lasting appeal lies in its ability to adapt to   
          changing times while maintaining its core essence of magic and 
           wonder. For children, unicorns represent imagination and the  
          belief that anything is possible. For adults, they offer       
          nostalgia and a connection to simpler times. In an             
          increasingly complex world, the unicorn serves as a reminder   
          to embrace beauty, believe in magic, and celebrate what makes  
          us unique.                                                     

⏺ I've expanded "The Modern Unicorn Renaissance" section significantly. The paragraph has been transformed from a single paragraph into a comprehensive section with six detailed paragraphs that now cover:

  1. Overview - Introduction to the unicorn's modern cultural transformation
  2. Culinary trends - Unicorn cakes, frappuccinos, and Instagram-worthy food
  3. Fashion & beauty - Makeup collections, unicorn hair trends, and merchandise
  4. Entertainment - Children's books, animated series, and toy franchises
  5. Tech industry - The "unicorn startup" phenomenon in Silicon Valley
  6. Psychological significance - Why unicorns resonate with millennials and Gen Z

  The section expanded from approximately 80 words to over 450 words, providing much more depth and specific examples while maintaining the document's original tone and style at demo.md:15-25.
