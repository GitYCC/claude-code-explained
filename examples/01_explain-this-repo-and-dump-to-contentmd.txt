  Repository Summary

  TempDD is a Template-Driven Development Framework that enables structured human-AI collaboration through customizable workflows. The explanation covers:

  1. Project Structure - Complete directory layout with 10 main components
  2. Core Purpose - Breaking development into AI-assisted documentation stages (PRD → Architecture → Research → Blueprint → Tasks)
  3. Technologies - Python 3.8+, PyYAML, rich, readchar
  4. Key Features:
    - Template-driven workflow system with YAML configs
    - Cross-AI tool integration (Claude Code, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot)
    - Intelligent symbol system for stage dependencies
    - Multilingual support
    - Fully customizable workflows
  5. Architecture - Execution flow from user commands through AI tools
  6. Core Modules - 8 main Python modules and their responsibilities
  7. Integration Points - How it connects with different AI development tools
  8. Customization - Config-based workflow tailoring without code changes

  The document is now available at CONTENT.md with full details about the framework's design, capabilities, and architecture.
