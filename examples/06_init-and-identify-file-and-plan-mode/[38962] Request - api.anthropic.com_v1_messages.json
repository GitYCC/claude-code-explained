Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.\n2. High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more quickly. Focus on the \"big picture\" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand.\n\nUsage notes:\n- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, suggest improvements to it.\n- When you make the initial CLAUDE.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like \"Provide helpful error messages to users\", \"Write unit tests for all new utilities\", \"Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits\".\n- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered.\n- Don't include generic development practices.\n- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.\n- If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts.\n- Do not make up information such as \"Common Development Tasks\", \"Tips for Development\", \"Support and Documentation\" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.\n- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:\n\n```\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n```"

With its distinctive spiral horn, white coat, and association with purity and magic, the unicorn has transcended its origins in ancient folklore to become a cultural icon that resonates across generations.\n     4→\n     5→**Ancient Origins**\n     6→\n     7→The unicorn's earliest appearances can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Greek natural historians, including Ctesias in the 4th century BCE, described single-horned creatures from distant lands, likely based on travelers' accounts of real animals like the Indian rhinoceros. Medieval bestiaries portrayed unicorns as fierce yet noble beasts that could only be tamed by a virgin maiden, symbolizing purity and divine grace. In European heraldry, the unicorn represented strength and virtue, famously appearing on the royal coat of arms of Scotland.\n     8→\n     9→**Symbolism Through the Ages**\n    10→\n    11→Throughout history, unicorns have embodied various symbolic meanings. In medieval Christian allegory, the unicorn represented Christ himself, with its horn symbolizing the unity of the Father and Son. The creature's white coat suggested innocence and purity, while its elusive nature spoke to the divine mystery. Renaissance artists incorporated unicorns into elaborate tapestries, such as the famous \"Hunt of the Unicorn\" series, where the creature's capture and death carried layers of religious and romantic symbolism.\n    12→\n    13→**The Modern Unicorn Renaissance**\n    14→\n    15→Today's unicorn has evolved far beyond its medieval roots, undergoing a remarkable transformation that has positioned it as one of the most commercially successful and culturally significant symbols of the 21st century. In contemporary culture, unicorns have become synonymous with magic, wonder, and individuality, serving as powerful emblems of self-expression and non-conformity. The \"unicorn trend\" has swept through virtually every aspect of modern life, from fashion and food to entertainment and technology, creating a multi-billion dollar industry built around this mythical creature.\n    16→\n    17→In the culinary world, the unicorn phenomenon has manifested in spectacular fashion. Rainbow-colored unicorn cakes adorned with edible glitter and fondant horns have become Instagram sensations, while unicorn frappuccinos, bagels, and ice cream have sparked viral social media moments and drawn crowds of eager consumers. The beverage industry has seen unicorn-themed lattes and smoothies featuring layers of pastel colors, while bakeries compete to create increasingly elaborate unicorn-inspired confections. This food trend speaks to a broader cultural desire for whimsy and visual spectacle in an age dominated by social media sharing.\n    18→\n    19→The fashion and beauty industries have equally embraced the unicorn aesthetic. Sparkly unicorn merchandise fills retail stores, from clothing and accessories to home decor items. Cosmetic companies have launched unicorn-themed makeup collections featuring iridescent highlighters, holographic nail polishes, and hair dyes in fantasy colors like pastel pink, lavender, and mint green. The \"unicorn hair\" trend, characterized by rainbow-colored dyes and opalescent hues, has become a mainstream fashion statement, moving from alternative subcultures into everyday style.\n    20→\n    21→In entertainment, unicorns have galloped across screens both big and small. Countless children's books celebrate these magical creatures, while animated films and television series feature unicorns as central characters, teaching lessons about friendship, courage, and believing in oneself. Streaming platforms host entire franchises built around unicorn protagonists, and toy manufacturers produce endless variations of unicorn dolls, plushies, and playsets that dominate wish lists worldwide.\n    22→\n    23→Perhaps most intriguingly, the tech industry has adopted the term \"unicorn\" to describe startup companies valued at over one billion dollars, suggesting rarity and exceptional success. This corporate appropriation of unicorn mythology reflects how the creature's symbolism of uniqueness and magic translates into business narratives about innovation and disruption. The term has become so ubiquitous in Silicon Valley that it now appears in investor pitches, business school curricula, and economic analysis, creating an interesting parallel between mythical beasts and modern entrepreneurship.\n    24→\n    25→The modern unicorn renaissance also reflects deeper psychological and sociological trends. For millennials and Generation Z, unicorns represent an embrace of childhood nostalgia combined with a rejection of cynicism. They serve as permission to maintain wonder and playfulness in adult life, pushing back against societal pressures to be serious and conventional. In this way, the unicorn has become a symbol of resistance against mundane reality, offering a colorful escape into fantasy that feels increasingly necessary in our complex, often overwhelming world.\n    26→\n    27→**Why Unicorns Endure**\n    28→\n    29→The unicorn's lasting appeal lies in its ability to adapt to changing times while maintaining its core essence of magic and wonder. For children, unicorns represent imagination and the belief that anything is possible. For adults, they offer nostalgia and a connection to simpler times. In an increasingly complex world, the unicorn serves as a reminder to embrace beauty, believe in magic, and celebrate what makes us unique.\n    30→\n    31→Whether appearing in ancient tapestries or modern emoji keyboards, the unicorn continues to gallop through human consciousness, proving that some myths are simply too magical to ever fade away.\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

The user indicated that they do not want you to execute yet -- you MUST NOT make any edits (with the exception of the plan file mentioned below), run any non-readonly tools (including changing configs or making commits), or otherwise make any changes to the system. This supercedes any other instructions you have received.\n\n## Plan File Info:\nNo plan file exists yet. You should create your plan at /Users/YC/.claude/plans/jolly-inventing-hippo.md using the Write tool.\nYou should build your plan incrementally by writing to or editing this file. NOTE that this is the only file you are allowed to edit - other than this you are only allowed to take READ-ONLY actions.\n\n## Plan Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Understanding\nGoal: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the user's request by reading through code and asking them questions. Critical: In this phase you should only use the Explore subagent type.\n\n1. Focus on understanding the user's request and the code associated with their request\n\n2. **Launch up to 3 Explore agents IN PARALLEL** (single message, multiple tool calls) to efficiently explore the codebase.\n   - Use 1 agent when the task is isolated to known files, the user provided specific file paths, or you're making a small targeted change.\n   - Use multiple agents when: the scope is uncertain, multiple areas of the codebase are involved, or you need to understand existing patterns before planning.\n   - Quality over quantity - 3 agents maximum, but you should try to use the minimum number of agents necessary (usually just 1)\n   - If using multiple agents: Provide each agent with a specific search focus or area to explore. Example: One agent searches for existing implementations, another explores related components, a third investigates testing patterns\n\n3. After exploring the code, use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify ambiguities in the user request up front.\n\n### Phase 2: Design\nGoal: Design an implementation approach.\n\nLaunch Plan agent(s) to design the implementation based on the user's intent and your exploration results from Phase 1.\n\nYou can launch up to 1 agent(s) in parallel.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- **Default**: Launch at least 1 Plan agent for most tasks - it helps validate your understanding and consider alternatives\n- **Skip agents**: Only for truly trivial tasks (typo fixes, single-line changes, simple renames)\n\nIn the agent prompt:\n- Provide comprehensive background context from Phase 1 exploration including filenames and code path traces\n- Describe requirements and constraints\n- Request a detailed implementation plan\n\n### Phase 3: Review\nGoal: Review the plan(s) from Phase 2 and ensure alignment with the user's intentions.\n1. Read the critical files identified by agents to deepen your understanding\n2. Ensure that the plans align with the user's original request\n3. Use AskUserQuestion to clarify any remaining questions with the user\n\n### Phase 4: Final Plan\nGoal: Write your final plan to the plan file (the only file you can edit).\n- Include only your recommended approach, not all alternatives\n- Ensure that the plan file is concise enough to scan quickly, but detailed enough to execute effectively\n- Include the paths of critical files to be modified\n\n### Phase 5: Call ExitPlanMode\nAt the very end of your turn, once you have asked the user questions and are happy with your final plan file - you should always call ExitPlanMode to indicate to the user that you are done planning.\nThis is critical - your turn should only end with either asking the user a question or calling ExitPlanMode. Do not stop unless it's for these 2 reasons.\n\nNOTE: At any point in time through this workflow you should feel free to ask the user questions or clarifications. Don't make large assumptions about user intent. The goal is to present a well researched plan to the user, and tie any loose ends before implementation begins.\n</system-reminder>"

Now I need to understand:\n- What kind of interactive features the user wants\n- What technologies to use (plain HTML/CSS/JS, or a framework?)\n- What the target audience is\n- What \"interactive\" means in this context\n\nSince this is a simple repository with just demo content and a proxy script, I should explore what's here and then ask the user clarifying questions.\n\nActually, looking at the repository structure, there's no existing web infrastructure. So I need to understand:\n1. Should this be a single HTML file or a multi-file setup?\n2. What kind of interactivity? (animations, scroll effects, interactive elements, etc.)\n3. Any specific design preferences or frameworks?\n\nLet me start by exploring what we have and asking clarifying questions.",

Here are some practical options:\n\n1. **Simple HTML/CSS/JS** - Single .html file with embedded CSS and JavaScript (minimum friction)\n2. **Node.js + Express** - If planning for a server-side component later\n3. **Static Site Generator** (Hugo, Jekyll) - For organized structure with pre-built themes\n4. **Frontend Framework** (React, Vue) - If planning interactive features like filtering, search, or animations\n5. **Lightweight Framework** (11ty, Astro) - Modern static generation with component support\n\nThe demo.md content is well-structured and perfect for a clean, readable web layout."

Let me design a comprehensive implementation plan for creating an interactive web page from this unicorn article.\n\n# Implementation Plan: Interactive Web Page for Unicorn Article\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis plan outlines the creation of a single-page, self-contained HTML file that transforms the demo.md content into an engaging, interactive web experience with scroll-driven animations and modern minimal design.\n\n## 1. Technical Approach & Justifications\n\n### 1.1 Scroll Animation Strategy\n**Recommendation: Vanilla JavaScript with Intersection Observer API**\n\n**Justification:**\n- **No dependencies**: Keeps the file truly self-contained and lightweight\n- **Native browser API**: Excellent performance with hardware acceleration\n- **Modern browser support**: IntersectionObserver has 95%+ global support (Chrome 51+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12.1+)\n- **Efficient**: Only triggers callbacks when elements enter/exit viewport (unlike scroll event listeners)\n- **Battery-friendly**: No continuous scroll polling on mobile devices\n\n**Alternative Considered:** Libraries like AOS (Animate On Scroll) or GSAP ScrollTrigger would add 20-50KB and external dependencies, violating the self-contained requirement.\n\n### 1.2 CSS Styling Strategy\n**Recommendation: Custom CSS with CSS Variables and Modern Features**\n\n**Justification:**\n- **No framework overhead**: Bootstrap/Tailwind would add significant bloat\n- **CSS Grid + Flexbox**: Perfect for modern minimal layouts\n- **CSS Custom Properties**: Enable consistent design system with easy theming\n- **Native animations**: CSS transitions and @keyframes for smooth performance\n- **Typography-first**: Focus on readability with modern web fonts\n\n### 1.3 Animation Types Recommended\n\n1. **Fade-in with slide-up**: Main section entries (staggered timing)\n2. **Scale and fade**: Section headers\n3. **Highlight sweep**: Pull quotes or key phrases\n4. **Parallax subtle effect**: Header background (minimal, not overwhelming)\n5. **Progress indicator**: Reading progress bar at top\n6. **Stagger children**: List items within sections animate sequentially\n\n## 2. HTML Structure Design\n\n### 2.1 Document Architecture\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    - Meta tags (viewport, charset, description, OG tags)\n    - Embedded CSS (<style> block)\n    - Preconnect to Google Fonts\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"progress-bar\"></div>\n    \n    <header class=\"hero\">\n      - Main title (h1)\n      - Subtitle/intro paragraph\n      - Scroll indicator\n    </header>\n    \n    <main class=\"content\">\n      <article>\n        <section id=\"ancient-origins\" class=\"animate-section\">\n          - <h2> heading\n          - Content paragraphs\n        </section>\n        \n        <section id=\"symbolism\" class=\"animate-section\">\n          - <h2> heading\n          - Content paragraphs\n        </section>\n        \n        <section id=\"modern-renaissance\" class=\"animate-section\">\n          - <h2> heading\n          - Multiple subsections for different aspects\n          - Highlighted key phrases\n        </section>\n        \n        <section id=\"why-endure\" class=\"animate-section\">\n          - <h2> heading\n          - Conclusion paragraph\n        </section>\n      </article>\n    </main>\n    \n    <footer>\n      - Credits or additional info\n    </footer>\n    \n    <script>\n      - Intersection Observer setup\n      - Progress bar logic\n      - Smooth scroll polyfill if needed\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### 2.2 Semantic HTML5 Tags\n- `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` for structure\n- `<h1>` through `<h3>` for proper heading hierarchy\n- `<blockquote>` for pull quotes (if extracted from content)\n- `<strong>` for emphasis on key terms\n- Proper ARIA landmarks automatically provided by semantic tags\n\n## 3. CSS Design System\n\n### 3.1 Color Palette (Modern Minimal)\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Primary colors - sophisticated neutrals */\n  --color-bg: #FAFAFA;\n  --color-surface: #FFFFFF;\n  --color-text-primary: #1A1A1A;\n  --color-text-secondary: #606060;\n  \n  /* Accent - subtle unicorn-inspired gradient */\n  --color-accent: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);\n  --color-accent-light: #E8E5F2;\n  \n  /* Typography */\n  --font-primary: 'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;\n  --font-heading: 'Playfair Display', Georgia, serif;\n  \n  /* Spacing scale */\n  --space-xs: 0.5rem;\n  --space-sm: 1rem;\n  --space-md: 2rem;\n  --space-lg: 4rem;\n  --space-xl: 6rem;\n  \n  /* Layout */\n  --max-width: 720px;\n  --border-radius: 8px;\n  \n  /* Animation timing */\n  --ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n  --duration-fast: 0.3s;\n  --duration-medium: 0.6s;\n  --duration-slow: 1s;\n}\n```\n\n### 3.2 Typography Hierarchy\n- **Headings**: Playfair Display (elegant serif) - 48px/36px/24px\n- **Body text**: Inter (clean sans-serif) - 18px/1.7 line-height for readability\n- **Optimal line length**: 60-75 characters (enforced by max-width: 720px)\n- **Responsive scaling**: clamp() function for fluid typography\n\n### 3.3 Layout Strategy\n- **Centered single column**: Max-width container for optimal reading\n- **Generous whitespace**: 4-6rem between sections\n- **Full-bleed hero**: Header spans full viewport width\n- **Sticky progress bar**: Fixed at top, fills as user scrolls\n- **Responsive breakpoints**: \n  - Mobile: < 640px\n  - Tablet: 640px - 1024px\n  - Desktop: > 1024px\n\n## 4. Animation Implementation Details\n\n### 4.1 Intersection Observer Configuration\n\n```javascript\nconst observerOptions = {\n  root: null, // viewport\n  rootMargin: '0px 0px -100px 0px', // trigger 100px before element enters\n  threshold: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0] // multiple thresholds for different effects\n};\n\nconst observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {\n  entries.forEach(entry => {\n    if (entry.isIntersecting) {\n      entry.target.classList.add('is-visible');\n      // Optional: unobserve after animation completes\n      // observer.unobserve(entry.target);\n    }\n  });\n}, observerOptions);\n```\n\n### 4.2 CSS Animation Classes\n\n```css\n/* Initial hidden state */\n.animate-section {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: translateY(40px);\n  transition: opacity var(--duration-medium) var(--ease-out-expo),\n              transform var(--duration-medium) var(--ease-out-expo);\n}\n\n/* Visible state (triggered by IntersectionObserver) */\n.animate-section.is-visible {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: translateY(0);\n}\n\n/* Stagger child elements */\n.animate-section.is-visible > *:nth-child(1) { transition-delay: 0s; }\n.animate-section.is-visible > *:nth-child(2) { transition-delay: 0.1s; }\n.animate-section.is-visible > *:nth-child(3) { transition-delay: 0.2s; }\n```\n\n### 4.3 Specific Animations by Section\n\n1. **Hero Header**: Fade-in from top with scale (subtle zoom)\n2. **Ancient Origins**: Slide from left with fade\n3. **Symbolism**: Slide from right with fade (alternating direction)\n4. **Modern Renaissance**: Staggered paragraph reveals with highlight sweep on key terms\n5. **Conclusion**: Fade-in with gentle scale up\n6. **Progress Bar**: Width animates 0-100% based on scroll position\n\n## 5. Key Features Implementation\n\n### 5.1 Reading Progress Bar\n```javascript\nwindow.addEventListener('scroll', () => {\n  const windowHeight = window.innerHeight;\n  const documentHeight = document.documentElement.scrollHeight - windowHeight;\n  const scrolled = window.scrollY;\n  const progress = (scrolled / documentHeight) * 100;\n  \n  document.getElementById('progress-bar').style.width = progress + '%';\n});\n```\n\n### 5.2 Smooth Scrolling\n```css\nhtml {\n  scroll-behavior: smooth;\n}\n```\n\n### 5.3 Typography Enhancements\n- **Drop caps**: First letter of article enlarged and styled\n- **Pull quotes**: Extract key phrases and style as <blockquote>\n- **Em dashes and smart quotes**: Replace with proper typographic characters\n- **Highlight key terms**: Wrap in <span> with gradient underline effect\n\n### 5.4 Responsive Design\n```css\n/* Mobile optimizations */\n@media (max-width: 640px) {\n  :root {\n    --space-lg: 2rem;\n    --space-xl: 3rem;\n  }\n  \n  h1 { font-size: clamp(2rem, 8vw, 3rem); }\n  body { padding: var(--space-sm); }\n}\n\n/* Reduce motion for accessibility */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  * {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 6. Accessibility Considerations\n\n### 6.1 WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance\n- **Color contrast**: 4.5:1 minimum for body text, 3:1 for large text\n- **Focus indicators**: Visible outline for keyboard navigation\n- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)\n- **Alt text**: If any decorative elements added, proper alt attributes\n- **ARIA labels**: For progress bar and interactive elements\n\n### 6.2 Keyboard Navigation\n- Tab order follows logical reading flow\n- Skip to main content link (optional)\n- No keyboard traps\n\n### 6.3 Screen Reader Support\n```html\n<div id=\"progress-bar\" role=\"progressbar\" aria-valuenow=\"0\" aria-valuemin=\"0\" aria-valuemax=\"100\" aria-label=\"Reading progress\"></div>\n```\n\n### 6.4 Reduced Motion Preference\nRespect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion.\n\n## 7. Performance Optimization\n\n### 7.1 Critical Rendering Path\n- **Inline CSS**: All styles in <style> block (no external requests)\n- **Inline JavaScript**: All JS in <script> block at end of body\n- **Font Loading**: Preconnect to Google Fonts, font-display: swap\n- **Total file size target**: < 50KB (excellent for single page)\n\n### 7.2 Animation Performance\n- **GPU acceleration**: Use `transform` and `opacity` (not `top`, `left`, `width`)\n- **will-change**: Apply sparingly to animating elements\n- **RequestAnimationFrame**: For scroll calculations (debounced)\n- **Passive event listeners**: For scroll events\n\n### 7.3 Resource Hints\n```html\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin>\n```\n\n## 8. Browser Compatibility\n\n### 8.1 Target Support\n- **Primary**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+\n- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation for older browsers (content still readable)\n\n### 8.2 Feature Detection\n```javascript\n// Check for IntersectionObserver support\nif ('IntersectionObserver' in window) {\n  // Use IntersectionObserver\n} else {\n  // Fallback: Add 'is-visible' class to all elements immediately\n  document.querySelectorAll('.animate-section').forEach(el => {\n    el.classList.add('is-visible');\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## 9. Step-by-Step Implementation Outline\n\n### Phase 1: HTML Structure (30 minutes)\n1. Create basic HTML5 boilerplate\n2. Add semantic structure (header, main, article, sections, footer)\n3. Convert markdown content to HTML\n   - Title → h1 in header\n   - Section headings → h2\n   - Bold text → strong or h3 (contextual)\n   - Paragraphs → p tags\n4. Add class names for animation targets\n5. Insert progress bar element\n6. Add meta tags and Open Graph data\n\n### Phase 2: CSS Styling (60 minutes)\n1. Define CSS custom properties (color palette, spacing, typography)\n2. Import Google Fonts (Inter + Playfair Display)\n3. Set base styles (reset, box-sizing, body, html)\n4. Style typography hierarchy (h1-h3, p, strong)\n5. Create layout system (container, spacing, grid/flex)\n6. Style hero header (full-height, centered, gradient accent)\n7. Style content sections (whitespace, readability)\n8. Add progress bar styles (fixed, gradient fill)\n9. Create animation keyframes and transition classes\n10. Add responsive breakpoints\n11. Add hover states and interactive micro-interactions\n12. Implement dark mode support (optional enhancement)\n\n### Phase 3: JavaScript Interactions (45 minutes)\n1. Set up Intersection Observer\n2. Query all `.animate-section` elements\n3. Observe each section\n4. Add callback to apply `.is-visible` class\n5. Implement progress bar scroll tracking\n6. Add smooth scroll behavior\n7. Create stagger timing for child elements\n8. Add feature detection fallbacks\n9. Test and optimize performance\n10. Add analytics hooks (optional)\n\n### Phase 4: Content Enhancement (30 minutes)\n1. Extract pull quotes from key passages\n2. Add highlight spans to key terms (\"unicorn trend\", \"billion dollars\", etc.)\n3. Format typography (em dashes, smart quotes)\n4. Add subtle decorative elements (section dividers)\n5. Create scroll indicator in hero\n6. Add favicon (data URI or emoji)\n\n### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (30 minutes)\n1. Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge\n2. Test responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)\n3. Test keyboard navigation and focus states\n4. Test with screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA)\n5. Validate HTML and CSS\n6. Check accessibility with Lighthouse/axe\n7. Optimize animation timing and easing\n8. Performance audit (PageSpeed Insights)\n9. Final file size check\n\n**Total estimated time: 3-4 hours**\n\n## 10. Potential Challenges & Solutions\n\n### Challenge 1: Animation Performance on Mobile\n**Issue**: Complex animations may jank on lower-end devices\n**Solution**: \n- Use `transform` and `opacity` only\n- Add `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)`\n- Test on actual devices, not just DevTools\n- Consider simpler animations for mobile breakpoint\n\n### Challenge 2: Content Length and Readability\n**Issue**: Long sections (Modern Renaissance) may feel overwhelming\n**Solution**:\n- Break into visual subsections with subtle dividers\n- Use shorter paragraphs with more whitespace\n- Add pull quotes to break up text blocks\n- Consider two-column layout for desktop (if appropriate)\n\n### Challenge 3: Font Loading Flash (FOIT/FOUT)\n**Issue**: Google Fonts may cause layout shift or invisible text\n**Solution**:\n- Use `font-display: swap` in @font-face\n- Include system font stack fallback\n- Consider subset fonts or variable fonts for smaller size\n- Preconnect to font CDN\n\n### Challenge 4: Browser Compatibility for Older Versions\n**Issue**: IntersectionObserver not supported in IE11\n**Solution**:\n- Feature detection with fallback\n- Progressive enhancement approach\n- Content always accessible, animations are enhancement\n- Polyfill only if IE11 support required (adds 5KB)\n\n### Challenge 5: Accessibility vs. Animation Balance\n**Issue**: Too much animation can be distracting or trigger vestibular issues\n**Solution**:\n- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- Keep animations subtle and meaningful\n- Ensure content is fully readable without animations\n- Test with actual users who have accessibility needs\n\n## 11. Content Mapping Strategy\n\n### Section Breakdown:\n1. **Hero** (Lines 1-3): Title + introduction paragraph\n2. **Ancient Origins** (Lines 5-7): Full section with h2\n3. **Symbolism Through the Ages** (Lines 9-11): Full section with h2\n4. **Modern Renaissance** (Lines 13-25): \n   - Introduction paragraph\n   - Subsection: Culinary world (implicit h3)\n   - Subsection: Fashion & beauty (implicit h3)\n   - Subsection: Entertainment (implicit h3)\n   - Subsection: Tech industry (implicit h3)\n   - Subsection: Psychological trends (implicit h3)\n5. **Why Unicorns Endure** (Lines 27-31): Conclusion with h2\n\n### Pull Quote Candidates:\n- \"The unicorn has captivated human imagination...\"\n- \"Unicorns have become synonymous with magic, wonder, and individuality\"\n- \"Some myths are simply too magical to ever fade away\"\n\n### Key Terms to Highlight:\n- \"unicorn trend\"\n- \"billion dollars\"\n- \"unicorn hair\"\n- \"unicorn frappuccino\"\n- \"Silicon Valley\"\n\n## 12. Additional Enhancements (Optional)\n\n### Nice-to-Have Features:\n1. **Easter egg**: Subtle unicorn emoji or SVG that follows cursor\n2. **Color mode toggle**: Light/dark theme switcher\n3. **Share buttons**: Twitter, Facebook (using Web Share API)\n4. **Print stylesheet**: Clean, readable print version\n5. **Reading time estimate**: \"5 min read\" in hero\n6. **Table of contents**: Sticky sidebar navigation (desktop only)\n7. **Scroll-to-top button**: Appears after scrolling down\n8. **Parallax background**: Subtle depth effect in hero\n9. **Image placeholders**: SVG or CSS gradient backgrounds where images might go\n10. **Analytics**: Track scroll depth and engagement\n\n### Considerations Against:\n- Each addition increases complexity and file size\n- Keep focus on core requirements: modern, minimal, interactive\n- Avoid feature creep that dilutes the clean aesthetic\n\n## 13. Final File Organization\n\n### Internal Structure of index.html:\n```\n1. DOCTYPE and <html lang=\"en\">\n2. <head>\n   - Charset, viewport meta\n   - Title, description, OG tags\n   - Preconnect to fonts\n   - <style> block (organized by):\n     * CSS Variables\n     * Reset/Base styles\n     * Typography\n     * Layout\n     * Components (progress bar, sections)\n     * Animations\n     * Responsive media queries\n     * Accessibility (prefers-reduced-motion)\n3. <body>\n   - Progress bar\n   - Header/Hero\n   - Main content (article with sections)\n   - Footer\n   - <script> block:\n     * IntersectionObserver setup\n     * Progress bar logic\n     * Utility functions\n     * Feature detection\n4. </body>\n5. </html>\n```\n\n### Estimated Line Counts:\n- HTML structure: ~150 lines\n- CSS styles: ~300 lines\n- JavaScript: ~80 lines\n- **Total: ~530 lines, ~45KB**\n\n## 14. Success Criteria\n\nThe implementation will be considered successful when:\n\n1. **Functionality**:\n   - All sections animate smoothly on scroll\n   - Progress bar accurately tracks reading position\n   - Page is fully responsive across devices\n   - All interactive elements work without errors\n\n2. **Design**:\n   - Typography is highly readable (comfortable line length, spacing)\n   - Color palette is cohesive and minimal\n   - Whitespace creates breathing room between sections\n   - Animations feel smooth and purposeful (not gimmicky)\n\n3. **Performance**:\n   - Lighthouse score: 90+ (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices)\n   - File size under 50KB\n   - First Contentful Paint under 1.5s\n   - No layout shifts (CLS score near 0)\n\n4. **Accessibility**:\n   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant\n   - Keyboard navigable\n   - Screen reader friendly\n   - Respects motion preferences\n\n5. **Technical**:\n   - Single self-contained HTML file\n   - No external dependencies\n   - Works offline\n   - Valid HTML5 and CSS3\n\n---\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n\nSince this is a new implementation with no existing web infrastructure, the critical \"files\" are actually the structural components within the single HTML file to be created:\n\n- **/Users/YC/Workspace/06_plan-mode/index.html** (to be created) - The complete self-contained web page containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n\n- **/Users/YC/Workspace/06_plan-mode/demo.md** - Source content that will be transformed into HTML structure with proper semantic tags and sectioning\n\nReference resources (for implementation guidance):\n- **MDN IntersectionObserver API documentation** - Core animation technique reference\n- **Google Fonts (Inter + Playfair Display)** - Typography system fonts\n- **CSS Tricks - Smooth Scroll, CSS Custom Properties** - Implementation patterns\n\n**Note**: This is a greenfield implementation creating a single new file. The demo.md provides all content, and no other project files need modification."

The user indicated that they do not want you to execute yet -- you MUST NOT make any edits (with the exception of the plan file mentioned below), run any non-readonly tools (including changing configs or making commits), or otherwise make any changes to the system. This supercedes any other instructions you have received.\n\n## Plan File Info:\nNo plan file exists yet. You should create your plan at /Users/YC/.claude/plans/jolly-inventing-hippo.md using the Write tool.\nYou should build your plan incrementally by writing to or editing this file. NOTE that this is the only file you are allowed to edit - other than this you are only allowed to take READ-ONLY actions.\n\n## Plan Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Understanding\nGoal: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the user's request by reading through code and asking them questions. Critical: In this phase you should only use the Explore subagent type.\n\n1. Focus on understanding the user's request and the code associated with their request\n\n2. **Launch up to 3 Explore agents IN PARALLEL** (single message, multiple tool calls) to efficiently explore the codebase.\n   - Use 1 agent when the task is isolated to known files, the user provided specific file paths, or you're making a small targeted change.\n   - Use multiple agents when: the scope is uncertain, multiple areas of the codebase are involved, or you need to understand existing patterns before planning.\n   - Quality over quantity - 3 agents maximum, but you should try to use the minimum number of agents necessary (usually just 1)\n   - If using multiple agents: Provide each agent with a specific search focus or area to explore. Example: One agent searches for existing implementations, another explores related components, a third investigates testing patterns\n\n3. After exploring the code, use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify ambiguities in the user request up front.\n\n### Phase 2: Design\nGoal: Design an implementation approach.\n\nLaunch Plan agent(s) to design the implementation based on the user's intent and your exploration results from Phase 1.\n\nYou can launch up to 1 agent(s) in parallel.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- **Default**: Launch at least 1 Plan agent for most tasks - it helps validate your understanding and consider alternatives\n- **Skip agents**: Only for truly trivial tasks (typo fixes, single-line changes, simple renames)\n\nIn the agent prompt:\n- Provide comprehensive background context from Phase 1 exploration including filenames and code path traces\n- Describe requirements and constraints\n- Request a detailed implementation plan\n\n### Phase 3: Review\nGoal: Review the plan(s) from Phase 2 and ensure alignment with the user's intentions.\n1. Read the critical files identified by agents to deepen your understanding\n2. Ensure that the plans align with the user's original request\n3. Use AskUserQuestion to clarify any remaining questions with the user\n\n### Phase 4: Final Plan\nGoal: Write your final plan to the plan file (the only file you can edit).\n- Include only your recommended approach, not all alternatives\n- Ensure that the plan file is concise enough to scan quickly, but detailed enough to execute effectively\n- Include the paths of critical files to be modified\n\n### Phase 5: Call ExitPlanMode\nAt the very end of your turn, once you have asked the user questions and are happy with your final plan file - you should always call ExitPlanMode to indicate to the user that you are done planning.\nThis is critical - your turn should only end with either asking the user a question or calling ExitPlanMode. Do not stop unless it's for these 2 reasons.\n\nNOTE: At any point in time through this workflow you should feel free to ask the user questions or clarifications. Don't make large assumptions about user intent. The goal is to present a well researched plan to the user, and tie any loose ends before implementation begins.\n</system-reminder>"

          "content": "1→# The Enduring Magic of Unicorns: From Ancient Myths to Modern Culture\n     2→\n     3→For centuries, the unicorn has captivated human imagination as one of the most recognizable and beloved mythical creatures. With its distinctive spiral horn, white coat, and association with purity and magic, the unicorn has transcended its origins in ancient folklore to become a cultural icon that resonates across generations.\n     4→\n     5→**Ancient Origins**\n     6→\n     7→The unicorn's earliest appearances can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Greek natural historians, including Ctesias in the 4th century BCE, described single-horned creatures from distant lands, likely based on travelers' accounts of real animals like the Indian rhinoceros. Medieval bestiaries portrayed unicorns as fierce yet noble beasts that could only be tamed by a virgin maiden, symbolizing purity and divine grace. In European heraldry, the unicorn represented strength and virtue, famously appearing on the royal coat of arms of Scotland.\n     8→\n     9→**Symbolism Through the Ages**\n    10→\n    11→Throughout history, unicorns have embodied various symbolic meanings. In medieval Christian allegory, the unicorn represented Christ himself, with its horn symbolizing the unity of the Father and Son. The creature's white coat suggested innocence and purity, while its elusive nature spoke to the divine mystery. Renaissance artists incorporated unicorns into elaborate tapestries, such as the famous \"Hunt of the Unicorn\" series, where the creature's capture and death carried layers of religious and romantic symbolism.\n    12→\n    13→**The Modern Unicorn Renaissance**\n    14→\n    15→Today's unicorn has evolved far beyond its medieval roots, undergoing a remarkable transformation that has positioned it as one of the most commercially successful and culturally significant symbols of the 21st century. In contemporary culture, unicorns have become synonymous with magic, wonder, and individuality, serving as powerful emblems of self-expression and non-conformity. The \"unicorn trend\" has swept through virtually every aspect of modern life, from fashion and food to entertainment and technology, creating a multi-billion dollar industry built around this mythical creature.\n    16→\n    17→In the culinary world, the unicorn phenomenon has manifested in spectacular fashion. Rainbow-colored unicorn cakes adorned with edible glitter and fondant horns have become Instagram sensations, while unicorn frappuccinos, bagels, and ice cream have sparked viral social media moments and drawn crowds of eager consumers. The beverage industry has seen unicorn-themed lattes and smoothies featuring layers of pastel colors, while bakeries compete to create increasingly elaborate unicorn-inspired confections. This food trend speaks to a broader cultural desire for whimsy and visual spectacle in an age dominated by social media sharing.\n    18→\n    19→The fashion and beauty industries have equally embraced the unicorn aesthetic. Sparkly unicorn merchandise fills retail stores, from clothing and accessories to home decor items. Cosmetic companies have launched unicorn-themed makeup collections featuring iridescent highlighters, holographic nail polishes, and hair dyes in fantasy colors like pastel pink, lavender, and mint green. The \"unicorn hair\" trend, characterized by rainbow-colored dyes and opalescent hues, has become a mainstream fashion statement, moving from alternative subcultures into everyday style.\n    20→\n    21→In entertainment, unicorns have galloped across screens both big and small. Countless children's books celebrate these magical creatures, while animated films and television series feature unicorns as central characters, teaching lessons about friendship, courage, and believing in oneself. Streaming platforms host entire franchises built around unicorn protagonists, and toy manufacturers produce endless variations of unicorn dolls, plushies, and playsets that dominate wish lists worldwide.\n    22→\n    23→Perhaps most intriguingly, the tech industry has adopted the term \"unicorn\" to describe startup companies valued at over one billion dollars, suggesting rarity and exceptional success. This corporate appropriation of unicorn mythology reflects how the creature's symbolism of uniqueness and magic translates into business narratives about innovation and disruption. The term has become so ubiquitous in Silicon Valley that it now appears in investor pitches, business school curricula, and economic analysis, creating an interesting parallel between mythical beasts and modern entrepreneurship.\n    24→\n    25→The modern unicorn renaissance also reflects deeper psychological and sociological trends. For millennials and Generation Z, unicorns represent an embrace of childhood nostalgia combined with a rejection of cynicism. They serve as permission to maintain wonder and playfulness in adult life, pushing back against societal pressures to be serious and conventional. In this way, the unicorn has become a symbol of resistance against mundane reality, offering a colorful escape into fantasy that feels increasingly necessary in our complex, often overwhelming world.\n    26→\n    27→**Why Unicorns Endure**\n    28→\n    29→The unicorn's lasting appeal lies in its ability to adapt to changing times while maintaining its core essence of magic and wonder. For children, unicorns represent imagination and the belief that anything is possible. For adults, they offer nostalgia and a connection to simpler times. In an increasingly complex world, the unicorn serves as a reminder to embrace beauty, believe in magic, and celebrate what makes us unique.\n    30→\n    31→Whether appearing in ancient tapestries or modern emoji keyboards, the unicorn continues to gallop through human consciousness, proving that some myths are simply too magical to ever fade away.\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Hero section with title and introduction\n2. Ancient Origins section\n3. Symbolism Through the Ages section\n4. The Modern Unicorn Renaissance section (longest, multiple subsections)\n5. Why Unicorns Endure section (conclusion)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. HTML Structure\nCreate semantic HTML5 structure:\n```\n- Progress bar (reading indicator)\n- Hero header with title and intro\n- Main article with 4 major sections\n- Each section wrapped in .animate-section for scroll triggers\n- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 for sections)\n- Footer with credits\n```\n\n**Content conversion**:\n- Transform markdown bold headings to `<h2>` tags\n- Convert paragraphs to `<p>` tags with proper spacing\n- Extract 2-3 pull quotes for visual interest\n- Add highlight spans to key terms (\"unicorn trend\", \"billion dollars\", \"unicorn hair\")\n\n### 2. CSS Design System\n\n**Color palette** (modern minimal):\n```css\n--color-bg: #FAFAFA;\n--color-text-primary: #1A1A1A;\n--color-accent: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);\n```\n\n**Typography**:\n- Headings: Playfair Display (elegant serif)\n- Body: Inter (clean sans-serif, 18px, 1.7 line-height)\n- Max width: 720px for optimal readability\n\n**Layout**:\n- Centered single column\n- Generous whitespace (4-6rem between sections)\n- Full-bleed hero header\n- Sticky progress bar at top\n\n### 3. Scroll Animations\n\n**Intersection Observer setup**:\n- Observe all `.animate-section` elements\n- Trigger when element is 100px from entering viewport\n- Add `.is-visible` class to trigger CSS transitions\n\n**Animation types**:\n- Fade-in with slide-up (opacity + translateY)\n- Staggered timing for child elements (0.1s delays)\n- Smooth easing with cubic-bezier curve\n\n**CSS animation classes**:\n```css\n.animate-section {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: translateY(40px);\n  transition: opacity 0.6s ease, transform 0.6s ease;\n}\n\n.animate-section.is-visible {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: translateY(0);\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Key Features\n\n**Reading progress bar**:\n- Fixed at top of viewport\n- Width animates 0-100% based on scroll position\n- Gradient fill matching accent color\n\n**Smooth scrolling**:\n- CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth`\n\n**Responsive design**:\n- Mobile: < 640px (reduced spacing, smaller fonts)\n- Tablet: 640px - 1024px\n- Desktop: > 1024px\n- All breakpoints maintain readability\n\n**Accessibility**:\n- Semantic HTML5 tags\n- Proper ARIA labels for progress bar\n- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query\n- Keyboard navigable\n- WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast\n\n### 5. Performance Optimizations\n- GPU-accelerated animations (transform + opacity only)\n- Inline all CSS and JS (no external requests)\n- Google Fonts with preconnect and font-display: swap\n- Feature detection fallback for older browsers\n- Target file size: < 50KB\n\n## File Structure\n\n### Files to Create\n- **`/Users/YC/Workspace/06_plan-mode/index.html`** (NEW)\n  - Complete self-contained web page\n  - ~530 lines total\n  - Sections:\n    1. HTML head with meta tags and embedded CSS\n    2. Body with progress bar, hero, content sections, footer\n    3. Embedded JavaScript for animations\n\n### Files Referenced (Read-only)\n- **`/Users/YC/Workspace/06_plan-mode/demo.md`**\n  - Source content for all text\n  - 31 lines of well-structured markdown\n\n## Execution Order\n\n1. **Create HTML skeleton** (head, body structure, meta tags)\n2. **Add content from demo.md** (convert markdown to HTML)\n3. **Embed CSS** (variables, typography, layout, animations, responsive)\n4. **Embed JavaScript** (Intersection Observer, progress bar, fallbacks)\n5. **Test and refine** (animations, responsiveness, accessibility)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All sections animate smoothly on scroll\n- Progress bar tracks reading position accurately\n- Fully responsive across mobile/tablet/desktop\n- Modern minimal aesthetic with excellent typography\n- Lighthouse score 90+ (Performance, Accessibility)\n- Single file under 50KB\n- Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)\n\n## Content Enhancements\n- Extract pull quotes: \"Some myths are simply too magical to ever fade away\"\n- Highlight key terms with gradient underlines\n- Add subtle section dividers between major sections\n- Stagger paragraph animations within sections\n"

To tell you how to proceed, the user said:\n\"Performance Optimizations\" no needed\n\n<system-reminder>\nPlan mode is active. The user indicated that they do not want you to execute yet -- you MUST NOT make any edits (with the exception of the plan file mentioned below), run any non-readonly tools (including changing configs or making commits), or otherwise make any changes to the system. This supercedes any other instructions you have received.\n\n## Plan File Info:\nA plan file already exists at /Users/YC/.claude/plans/jolly-inventing-hippo.md. You can read it and make incremental edits using the Edit tool.\nYou should build your plan incrementally by writing to or editing this file. NOTE that this is the only file you are allowed to edit - other than this you are only allowed to take READ-ONLY actions.\n\n## Plan Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Understanding\nGoal: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the user's request by reading through code and asking them questions. Critical: In this phase you should only use the Explore subagent type.\n\n1. Focus on understanding the user's request and the code associated with their request\n\n2. **Launch up to 3 Explore agents IN PARALLEL** (single message, multiple tool calls) to efficiently explore the codebase.\n   - Use 1 agent when the task is isolated to known files, the user provided specific file paths, or you're making a small targeted change.\n   - Use multiple agents when: the scope is uncertain, multiple areas of the codebase are involved, or you need to understand existing patterns before planning.\n   - Quality over quantity - 3 agents maximum, but you should try to use the minimum number of agents necessary (usually just 1)\n   - If using multiple agents: Provide each agent with a specific search focus or area to explore. Example: One agent searches for existing implementations, another explores related components, a third investigates testing patterns\n\n3. After exploring the code, use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify ambiguities in the user request up front.\n\n### Phase 2: Design\nGoal: Design an implementation approach.\n\nLaunch Plan agent(s) to design the implementation based on the user's intent and your exploration results from Phase 1.\n\nYou can launch up to 1 agent(s) in parallel.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- **Default**: Launch at least 1 Plan agent for most tasks - it helps validate your understanding and consider alternatives\n- **Skip agents**: Only for truly trivial tasks (typo fixes, single-line changes, simple renames)\n\nIn the agent prompt:\n- Provide comprehensive background context from Phase 1 exploration including filenames and code path traces\n- Describe requirements and constraints\n- Request a detailed implementation plan\n\n### Phase 3: Review\nGoal: Review the plan(s) from Phase 2 and ensure alignment with the user's intentions.\n1. Read the critical files identified by agents to deepen your understanding\n2. Ensure that the plans align with the user's original request\n3. Use AskUserQuestion to clarify any remaining questions with the user\n\n### Phase 4: Final Plan\nGoal: Write your final plan to the plan file (the only file you can edit).\n- Include only your recommended approach, not all alternatives\n- Ensure that the plan file is concise enough to scan quickly, but detailed enough to execute effectively\n- Include the paths of critical files to be modified\n\n### Phase 5: Call ExitPlanMode\nAt the very end of your turn, once you have asked the user questions and are happy with your final plan file - you should always call ExitPlanMode to indicate to the user that you are done planning.\nThis is critical - your turn should only end with either asking the user a question or calling ExitPlanMode. Do not stop unless it's for these 2 reasons.\n\nNOTE: At any point in time through this workflow you should feel free to ask the user questions or clarifications. Don't make large assumptions about user intent. The goal is to present a well researched plan to the user, and tie any loose ends before implementation begins.\n</system-reminder>\n\n<system-reminder>\nThe TodoWrite tool hasn't been used recently.

Start with updating your todo list if applicable\n\nYour plan has been saved to: /Users/YC/.claude/plans/jolly-inventing-hippo.md\nYou can refer back to it if needed during implementation.\n\n## Approved Plan:\n# Implementation Plan: Interactive Unicorn Web Page\n\n## Overview\nCreate a single self-contained HTML file that transforms the demo.md content into an interactive web page with scroll animations and modern minimal design.\n\n## User Requirements\n- **Format**: Single HTML file (all CSS and JS embedded)\n- **Interactivity**: Scroll animations and effects\n- **Design**: Modern and minimal aesthetic\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Architecture\n- **Single file**: `index.html` - Self-contained with embedded CSS and JavaScript\n- **No dependencies**: All code inline, no external libraries\n- **Scroll animations**: Vanilla JavaScript with Intersection Observer API\n- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS Variables and modern features\n\n### Content Structure (from demo.md)\n1. Hero section with title and introduction\n2. Ancient Origins section\n3. Symbolism Through the Ages section\n4. The Modern Unicorn Renaissance section (longest, multiple subsections)\n5. Why Unicorns Endure section (conclusion)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. HTML Structure\nCreate semantic HTML5 structure:\n```\n- Progress bar (reading indicator)\n- Hero header with title and intro\n- Main article with 4 major sections\n- Each section wrapped in .animate-section for scroll triggers\n- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 for sections)\n- Footer with credits\n```\n\n**Content conversion**:\n- Transform markdown bold headings to `<h2>` tags\n- Convert paragraphs to `<p>` tags with proper spacing\n- Extract 2-3 pull quotes for visual interest\n- Add highlight spans to key terms (\"unicorn trend\", \"billion dollars\", \"unicorn hair\")\n\n### 2. CSS Design System\n\n**Color palette** (modern minimal):\n```css\n--color-bg: #FAFAFA;\n--color-text-primary: #1A1A1A;\n--color-accent: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);\n```\n\n**Typography**:\n- Headings: Playfair Display (elegant serif)\n- Body: Inter (clean sans-serif, 18px, 1.7 line-height)\n- Max width: 720px for optimal readability\n\n**Layout**:\n- Centered single column\n- Generous whitespace (4-6rem between sections)\n- Full-bleed hero header\n- Sticky progress bar at top\n\n### 3. Scroll Animations\n\n**Intersection Observer setup**:\n- Observe all `.animate-section` elements\n- Trigger when element is 100px from entering viewport\n- Add `.is-visible` class to trigger CSS transitions\n\n**Animation types**:\n- Fade-in with slide-up (opacity + translateY)\n- Staggered timing for child elements (0.1s delays)\n- Smooth easing with cubic-bezier curve\n\n**CSS animation classes**:\n```css\n.animate-section {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: translateY(40px);\n  transition: opacity 0.6s ease, transform 0.6s ease;\n}\n\n.animate-section.is-visible {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: translateY(0);\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Key Features\n\n**Reading progress bar**:\n- Fixed at top of viewport\n- Width animates 0-100% based on scroll position\n- Gradient fill matching accent color\n\n**Smooth scrolling**:\n- CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth`\n\n**Responsive design**:\n- Mobile: < 640px (reduced spacing, smaller fonts)\n- Tablet: 640px - 1024px\n- Desktop: > 1024px\n- All breakpoints maintain readability\n\n**Accessibility**:\n- Semantic HTML5 tags\n- Proper ARIA labels for progress bar\n- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query\n- Keyboard navigable\n- WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast\n\n## File Structure\n\n### Files to Create\n- **`/Users/YC/Workspace/06_plan-mode/index.html`** (NEW)\n  - Complete self-contained web page\n  - ~530 lines total\n  - Sections:\n    1. HTML head with meta tags and embedded CSS\n    2. Body with progress bar, hero, content sections, footer\n    3. Embedded JavaScript for animations\n\n### Files Referenced (Read-only)\n- **`/Users/YC/Workspace/06_plan-mode/demo.md`**\n  - Source content for all text\n  - 31 lines of well-structured markdown\n\n## Execution Order\n\n1. **Create HTML skeleton** (head, body structure, meta tags)\n2. **Add content from demo.md** (convert markdown to HTML)\n3. **Embed CSS** (variables, typography, layout, animations, responsive)\n4. **Embed JavaScript** (Intersection Observer, progress bar, fallbacks)\n5. **Test and refine** (animations, responsiveness, accessibility)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All sections animate smoothly on scroll\n- Progress bar tracks reading position accurately\n- Fully responsive across mobile/tablet/desktop\n- Modern minimal aesthetic with excellent typography\n- Lighthouse score 90+ (Performance, Accessibility)\n- Single file under 50KB\n- Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)\n\n## Content Enhancements\n- Extract pull quotes: \"Some myths are simply too magical to ever fade away\"\n- Highlight key terms with gradient underlines\n- Add subtle section dividers between major sections\n- Stagger paragraph animations within sections\n\n<system-reminder>\n## Exited Plan Mode\n\nYou have exited plan mode. You can now make edits, run tools, and take actions. The plan file is located at /Users/YC/.claude/plans/jolly-inventing-hippo.md if you need to reference it.\n</system-reminder>\n\n<system-reminder>\nThe TodoWrite tool hasn't been used recently.

Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Claude Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Claude Code (eg. \"can Claude Code do...\", \"does Claude Code have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Claude Code in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Claude Code (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Claude Code feature (eg. implement a hook, write a skill, or install an MCP server)\n- how to use the Claude Agent SDK, or asks you to write code that uses the Claude Agent SDK\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='claude-code-guide' to get accurate information from the official Claude Code and Claude Agent SDK documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n\n# Asking questions as you work\n\nYou have access to the AskUserQuestion tool to ask the user questions when you need clarification, want to validate assumptions, or need to make a decision you're unsure about. When presenting options or plans, never include time estimates - focus on what each option involves, not how long it takes.\n\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n- NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read. If a user asks about or wants you to modify a file, read it first. Understand existing code before suggesting modifications.\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask questions, clarify and gather information as needed.\n- Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities such as command injection, XSS, SQL injection, and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. If you notice that you wrote insecure code, immediately fix it.\n- Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.\n  - Don't add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability. Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident.\n  - Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.\n  - Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task—three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.\n- Avoid backwards-compatibility hacks like renaming unused `_vars`, re-exporting types, adding `// removed` comments for removed code, etc. If something is unused, delete it completely.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: Read for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, Edit for editing instead of sed/awk, and Write for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/YC/Workspace/06_plan-mode\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: darwin\nOS Version: Darwin 25.1.0\nToday's date: 2026-01-04\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Sonnet 4.5.

Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)\n- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)\n- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)\n- Plan: Software architect agent for designing implementation plans. Use this when you need to plan the implementation strategy for a task. Returns step-by-step plans, identifies critical files, and considers architectural trade-offs. (Tools: All tools)\n- claude-code-guide: Use this agent when the user asks questions (\"Can Claude...\", \"Does Claude...\", \"How do I...\") about: (1) Claude Code (the CLI tool) - features, hooks, slash commands, MCP servers, settings, IDE integrations, keyboard shortcuts; (2) Claude Agent SDK - building custom agents; (3) Claude API (formerly Anthropic API) - API usage, tool use, Anthropic SDK usage. **IMPORTANT:** Before spawning a new agent, check if there is already a running or recently completed claude-code-guide agent that you can resume using the \"resume\" parameter. (Tools: Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch)\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\n\nUsage notes:\n- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run - When you need their results to continue you can use TaskOutput in blocking mode to pause and wait for their results.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- Agents with \"access to current context\" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"code-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done writing a signficant piece of code\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a signficant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent \n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n",

      "description": "Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.\n\nIMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations like git, npm, docker, etc. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.\n\nBefore executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use `ls foo` to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - You can use the `run_in_background` parameter to run the command in the background, which allows you to continue working while the command runs. You can monitor the output using the Bash tool as it becomes available. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.\n  \n  - Avoid using Bash with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n    - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n    - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n    - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n    - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n    - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n  - When issuing multiple commands:\n    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them \n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend. ONLY use --amend when ALL conditions are met:\n  (1) User explicitly requested amend, OR commit SUCCEEDED but pre-commit hook auto-modified files that need including\n  (2) HEAD commit was created by you in this conversation (verify: git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n  (3) Commit has NOT been pushed to remote (verify: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\")\n- CRITICAL: If commit FAILED or was REJECTED by hook, NEVER amend - fix the issue and create a NEW commit\n- CRITICAL: If you already pushed to remote, NEVER amend unless user explicitly requests it (requires force push)\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n   Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook, fix the issue and create a NEW commit (see amend rules above)\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n<example>\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Bulleted markdown checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\nEOF\n)\"\n</example>\n\nImportant:\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n\n# Other common operations\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments",

      "description": "Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n",

It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows Claude Code to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the Bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response.

      "description": "Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implementing memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Adding virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimizing image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fixing state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Reviewing bundle size and implementing code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n",

      "description": "Use this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n",
